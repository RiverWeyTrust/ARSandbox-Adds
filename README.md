# ARSandbox-Adds
Scripts and configs added to the River Wey Trust AR Sandbox implementation.
The Trust’s version of the SARndbox has a number of ‘added features’ culled from trawling the forum, 
and with some home written scripting and configs. Perhaps not always elegant, and probably inefficient 
for those more skilled in Linux etc... but for the sake of sharing and supporting 
Oliver Kraylos’ stunning generous gift of the original code and concept, these notes describe what we currently have.

PLEASE NOTE that all these files were set for Version 2.7 of the SARndbox, and Version 5.2 of VRUI. 
All references will need to be updated to match your installation versions and directories!
